# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## Challenge Type

### On-the-job ticket 
My Challenge is an on-the-job ticket&mdash;meaning that you'll begin with starter code that you need to modify. 

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

## Mock-Up

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

![The Horiseon webpage includes a navigation bar, a header image, and cards with text and images at the bottom of the page.](./Assets/01-html-css-git-homework-demo.png)

## Coding that I attempted to change. 
I substitute the html element div into semantic html elements.
1. div with class "header" changed into header with class header. 
2. div into nav, for unordered lists. 
3. figure for huge image that represent this company
4. article for the class "content"
5. sections for each area explaining SEO, Online Reputation Management, and Social Media Marketing respectively. 
6. aside for the class "benefits"
7. sections for each benefits Lead Generation, Brand Awareness, and Cost Management respectively. 
8. footer element for class "footer" 

I have put each comment for each semantic elements. 

I have put alt attribute and title attribute for each image and icons in the sections, and huge image at "figure"

I have fixed the title into Horiseon, 

I have put alt attribute for title of the webpage in the heading attribute.
